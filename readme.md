# Words that deserve to be used more

I came across [this list](https://wordwarriors.wayne.edu/list) of neglected words and wanted to do something with it.

This code is from a stream doing just that.

First, we got the data (./getData.ts).

Second, we built an API to serve the data:
- /words/random -> JSON of a random word
- /words/{id} -> JSON of a word by ID
- /words -> HTML of the "word of the day"

What should we do next?
